A separate folder of plots is generated for each Tuple in the array. The series can be specified in the Tuple in one of three ways:\nresults dictionary values: A two-element Tuple, where the first element is a String matching a key in the results dictionary output from multifrequency_opf and the second element is an Int specifying a subnetwork. This plots the values of this key and subnetwork entry on the x axis.\nnetwork data values: A Tuple with elements corresponding to keys at each level of the network data dictionary, identifying any network variable value. This plots the values of the specified network variable on the x axis. Any key in the Tuple may be an Array, in which case a separate plot is generated for each key. For example, to generate four plots, the active and reactive power at the origin (\"f\") bus and destination (\"t\") bus for branch 1 in subnetwork 2, use the Tuple (\"nw\",2,\"branch\",1,[\"pt\",\"pf\",\"qt\",\"qf\"])\ncustom values: A two-element Tuple, where the first element is a String not matching any keys in the results dictionary and the second element is an Array. This plots the values in the Array on the x axis with the label in the String.\ny_axis::Array: Array of Tuples identifying the y axis series for which plots should be generated over the points in the frequency sweep. A separate folder of plots is generated for each Tuple in the array. These are specified in the same way as x_axis.\ngen_areas: all areas in which generation should be minimized if obj==\"areagen\"\narea_transfer: two areas with power transfer between them that should be saved and plotted. Results for P, Q, S, and loss are saved for power transfer between the two areas.

Results for P, Q, S, and loss are saved for power transfer between the two zones. Must have exactly two elements.\nplot_vert_line::Tuple: x values of vertical lines to overlay on the plot. The first element is a scalar or Array specifying one or more x values to plot, and the second element is a String or Array of Strings specifying the label or labels. Default ([],\"\") does not add any lines to the plot.\nplot_horiz_line::Tuple: y values of horizontal lines to overlay on the plot. The first element is a scalar or Array specifying one or more y values to plot, and the second element is a String or Array of Strings specifying the label or labels. Default ([],\"\") does not add any lines to the plot.\nxlimits::Array{Any,1}: Array of two values specifying the min and max x axis limits to apply to the plots, overriding any other limits. Default [] does not change the plot.\nylimits::Array{Any,1}: Array of two values specifying the min and max y axis limits to apply to the plots, overriding any other limits. Default [] does not change the plot.\noutput_plot_label::Tuple{String,String}: specifies the plot to pass to the output. The first element must match the x axis label, and the second must match the y axis label.\nscopf::Bool: if true, model and solve the N-1 security constrained OPF for each network.
